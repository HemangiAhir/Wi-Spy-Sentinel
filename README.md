\*\*Wi-Spy Sentinel 2.0\*\* is a complete Wi-Fi security auditing and threat intelligence platform that turns your \*\*Flipper Zero\*\* into a powerful wardriving and rogue AP detection tool.



It collects real Wi-Fi scans, stores them in a local database, automatically detects malicious/suspicious networks, and generates \*\*beautiful comparative visualizations\*\* — like the one below showing how much safer your home Wi-Fi is compared to public hotspots.
